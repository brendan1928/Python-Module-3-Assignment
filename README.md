# Python-Module-3-Assignment
Assignment containing automated analysis and summaries for both pyBank and pyPoll datasets

The data sources for this assignment were given by the UoT facility. The written code is sourced by myself, Brendan H.
The first file, pyBank, attempts to read bank data and summarize profit changes over time.
The second file, pyPoll, attempts to read vote data and summarize votes by candidate and elect a winner based on popular vote.
The bank/financial data summarizer is located in the PyBank folder. In there the .csv and created .txt file will also be located, under Resources/analysis folders respectively.
The voter/poll data summarizer is loacted in the PyPoll folder. In there the .csv and created .txt file will also be located, under Resources/analysis folders respectively.

These .py files have no additional dependencies and should be able to run as presented. When running the files, ensure you navigate to the folder where main.py is stored using the 'cd' command so that the csv path readers can work as it uses a relative path.
